# Grupa2-Codebusters

*******************************************************************************************************************************************

Project is worked for subject named object-oriented analysis and design. I worked in a team of 3 members. Our assignment was to make
an application that is something like an imitation of social media. The focus was on everything before coding. 
Focus was in creating diagrams, specifications, design...
Idea was to go through every step in creating an application.

Although, there is only one contributor, I assure you that everyone form the team worked on this project. The contributor was leader of the team. 
She gave us tasks, and we sent her back everything done, and then she used to push that to repository. This happened two years ago, and we didn't work properly, but know, I know very well how to work in team.
